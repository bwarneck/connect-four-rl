   "source": "# Connect Four DQN Training Visualization\n\nThis notebook trains a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent to play Connect Four through self-play and visualizes the learning process.\n\n## What is DQN?\n\nDQN combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to handle large state spaces. Traditional Q-learning stores a value for every state-action pair in a table, but Connect Four has ~4.5 trillion possible states—far too many to store. Instead, DQN uses a neural network to *approximate* Q-values, learning patterns that generalize across similar positions.\n\n## Key DQN Components\n\n| Component | Purpose |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **Policy Network** | Predicts Q-values for actions; used to make decisions |\n| **Target Network** | Provides stable training targets; updated periodically |\n| **Replay Buffer** | Stores past experiences; random sampling breaks correlations |\n| **Epsilon-Greedy** | Balances exploration (random moves) vs exploitation (best moves) |\n\n## What to Expect\n\nBy the end of training, the agent should:\n- Win 80-90% of games against a random opponent\n- Show strategic play (blocking, setting up wins)\n- Demonstrate first-player advantage (~60% P1 win rate in self-play)"

Training Loop with Live Visualization\n\nThe agent learns through **self-play**: it plays both sides of every game, learning from wins and losses simultaneously.\n\n### How Self-Play Training Works\n\n1. **Play a game**: Agent chooses moves for both players using epsilon-greedy exploration\n2. **Collect transitions**: Store each (state, action, next_state, done) tuple\n3. **Assign rewards**: After game ends, assign +1 (win), -1 (loss), or 0 (draw) to each move\n4. **Train on batch**: Sample random transitions from replay buffer and update network\n5. **Decay epsilon**: Gradually shift from exploration to exploitation\n\n### Why Self-Play?\n\n- **No opponent needed**: Agent generates its own training data\n- **Curriculum learning**: As agent improves, it faces stronger opposition automatically\n- **Balanced training**: Sees positions from both winning and losing perspectives\n\n### Metrics Tracked\n\n| Metric | What it Shows |\n|--------|---------------|\n| P1/P2 Win Rate | Should stabilize ~60/40 due to first-player advantage |\n| Draw Rate | Very low in Connect Four (game usually has a winner) |\n| Epsilon | Decays per step, hits 0.01 floor around episode 400-500 |\n| Avg Game Length | Typically 15-25 moves; longer games suggest defensive play |\n| Loss | Training loss; should stabilize (not necessarily decrease) |\n\n**Expected output:** Progress updates every 500 episodes showing win rates, epsilon, and loss."

   "source": "## 5. Visualize Agent's Decision Making\n\nPeek inside the agent's \"mind\" by visualizing the Q-values it assigns to each possible move. This helps us understand *why* the agent chooses certain actions.\n\n### What are Q-Values?\n\nQ-values represent the agent's estimate of **expected future reward** for taking an action in a given state. Higher Q-value = agent believes this move leads to better outcomes.\n\n```\nQ(state, action) ≈ expected total reward if I take this action and play optimally afterward\n```\n\n### Reading the Visualization\n\n**Left panel (Board):**\n- Shows current game state\n- Red = Player 1 pieces, Yellow = Player 2 pieces\n- Indicates whose turn it is\n\n**Right panel (Q-Values):**\n- Bar height = Q-value for dropping piece in that column\n- **Green bars** = Legal moves (column not full)\n- **Red bars** = Illegal moves (column full)\n- **Blue dashed line** = Agent's chosen action (highest Q among legal moves)\n\n### What to Look For\n\n- **Winning moves** should have highest Q-values (approaching +1)\n- **Blocking moves** (preventing opponent win) should have high Q-values\n- **Losing moves** should have low/negative Q-values\n- **Illegal columns** may have any Q-value (agent learns to ignore them)\n\n**Expected output:** Board visualization with corresponding Q-value bar chart showing the agent's evaluation of each column."

This allows you to:\n\n- **Play against the agent** using `python src/play.py`\n- **Continue training** by loading weights and resuming\n- **Compare versions** by saving checkpoints at different training stages\n- **Deploy** the agent in other applications\n\n### What Gets Saved\n\nThe `.pth` file (PyTorch format) contains:\n- Policy network weights and architecture\n- Target network weights\n- Optimizer state (for resuming training)\n- Training statistics (episodes, steps, epsilon)\n- Replay buffer is **not** saved (would be very large)\n\n### File Size\n\nExpect ~2-5 MB for this architecture. The network has:\n- ~500K parameters in convolutional layers\n- ~100K parameters in fully connected layers\n\n**Expected output:** Confirmation of save location and final training statistics including total episodes, training steps, final epsilon, and replay buffer size."
